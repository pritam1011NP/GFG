Hello, I'm Pritam Majumder ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Data Science at the University of Kalyani and actively preparing myself for a career as a data scientist. One of my key learning strategies is solving coding problems daily on GeeksforGeeks (GFG), where I improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
